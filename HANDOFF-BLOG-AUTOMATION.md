# Blog Automation Handoff — utilities & internal linking

This is the brief for whatever writes the scheduled blog posts (the AI writer /
automation that `POST`s to the blog API). Two things must be right on every
post: **which utility serves the city**, and **internal links to our service
pages**. Paste the rules below into the writer's system prompt / content brief.

---

## 1. How posts reach the site

Posts are created by `POST`ing to **`/api/blog/publish`** with a bearer token.
You send Markdown (or raw Lexical); the API converts it, stores it, and (for
`status: "published"`) makes it live immediately. `status: "draft"` with a
`scheduled_for`-style flow is published later by the cron worker
(`/api/cron/tick`, run on a Vercel schedule).

- **Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer <BLOG_API_TOKEN>` (the token already
  configured for the automation — do not paste it into posts or commits).
- **List recent posts** to avoid duplicate slugs/topics: `GET /api/blog/publish`.
- After publish the API revalidates `/blog`, the new post, and the sitemap
  automatically — no extra cache step needed for API-created posts.

Minimal body:

```json
{
  "title": "Why a Panel Upgrade Pays Off in Pasadena",
  "markdown": "## Intro\n\nFull post body in Markdown …",
  "excerpt": "One-sentence summary for cards and meta description.",
  "categories": ["Panel Upgrades"],
  "heroImageUrl": "https://…/hero.jpg",
  "heroImageAlt": "200-amp electrical panel installed in a Pasadena home",
  "status": "published"
}
```

## 2. Utility per city — get this right

Getting the utility wrong undercuts trust with local readers immediately, and
it is easy to get wrong here: **four different municipal utilities** operate
inside our service area, and the largest of them is the City of Los Angeles
itself.

The rule is about the **jurisdiction**, not the place name. Ask first: is this
service area inside the City of Los Angeles?

| Utility | Serves | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **LADWP** (Los Angeles Dept. of Water & Power) | Neighborhoods **inside the City of Los Angeles** — most of our San Fernando Valley and Northeast LA service areas | Municipal. This is the one the old version of this table got wrong. |
| **PWP** (Pasadena Water & Power) | **Pasadena** | Municipal. Rebates: up to **$1,000** panel upgrade, up to **$600** home EV charger. Say "up to" and "confirm current terms with PWP". |
| **GWP** (Glendale Water & Power) | **Glendale** | Municipal. Has its own rebate programs — never cite SCE amounts for Glendale. |
| **BWP** (Burbank Water & Power) | **Burbank** | Municipal. Own programs; don't quote a number, say "check BWP's current rebates". |
| **SCE** (Southern California Edison) | The **independent cities** we serve and the **unincorporated county** areas | Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Calabasas, Arcadia, Alhambra, San Marino, Sierra Madre, South Pasadena, Temple City, San Gabriel, Monrovia, Rosemead, Montebello, Monterey Park, Baldwin Park, Duarte, El Monte, La Cañada Flintridge, Long Beach, Thousand Oaks, Oxnard, and unincorporated **Altadena** and **La Crescenta**. |

### Which of our service areas are City of Los Angeles (→ LADWP)

Arleta · Canoga Park · Chatsworth · Eagle Rock · Encino · Granada Hills ·
Hancock Park · Highland Park · Hollywood · Los Feliz · Melrose · Mission Hills ·
North Hills · North Hollywood · Northridge · Porter Ranch · Reseda ·
Sherman Oaks · Studio City · Sun Valley · Sunland · Sylmar · Tarzana ·
Toluca Lake · Tujunga · Van Nuys · West Hills · Woodland Hills

### Three traps

1. **"San Fernando" is not the City of Los Angeles.** The City of San Fernando
   is its own incorporated municipality surrounded by LA, so it is *not* on
   LADWP. Verify before naming a utility in a San Fernando post rather than
   assuming either way. (The *San Fernando Valley* as a region is mostly City
   of LA, and mostly LADWP — the two are easy to conflate.)
2. **LADWP's territory has SCE pockets.** LADWP's own service maps mark areas
   inside the Valley as "Served by SCE". For a neighborhood post, "most of
   {neighborhood} is served by LADWP" is safer and still specific; save the
   absolute phrasing for Pasadena, Glendale and Burbank, where the municipal
   boundary is the city boundary.
3. **Montrose is inside the City of Glendale; La Crescenta is not.** They are
   usually named together as "La Crescenta-Montrose", but Montrose sits within
   Glendale city limits (GWP) while La Crescenta is unincorporated county
   (SCE). If a post covers both, don't give them one utility.

**Rules for the writer:**

- Decide the jurisdiction first, then the utility. Pasadena → PWP,
  Glendale → GWP, Burbank → BWP, City of LA neighborhood → LADWP, otherwise
  → SCE.
- It's fine — and good for search — to mention SCE as a *contrast* in a
  municipal-utility post ("unlike SCE customers, Pasadena homeowners go through
  PWP…"). That targets real queries like *"PWP vs SCE Pasadena"*.
- Only PWP's rebate figures are quoted in this doc. For LADWP, GWP and BWP, say
  "check the utility's current rebate program" rather than inventing a number.
- High-value, low-competition keywords to work in naturally where relevant:
  *Pasadena Water and Power panel upgrade*, *PWP panel upgrade rebate*, *PWP EV
  charger rebate*, *PWP vs SCE Pasadena*, *Glendale Water and Power panel
  upgrade*, *LADWP panel upgrade*, *LADWP EV charger rebate*,
  *SCE Charge Ready Home eligibility*.

### Permit authority, while you're at it

The same jurisdiction question answers who issues the permit, and naming it is
one of the most useful city-specific details a post can carry:

- City of LA neighborhood → **LADBS** (LA Dept. of Building & Safety)
- Unincorporated county (Altadena, La Crescenta) → **LA County Public Works,
  Building & Safety**
- Any independent city → **that city's own building division** (e.g. "the City
  of Arcadia Building Services Division")

## 3. Internal links to service pages

Linking topic mentions to the matching service page is one of the strongest
on-page SEO signals we have. **The blog API now does a baseline pass of this
automatically** (`src/lib/auto-link-services.ts`): on every publish it links the
**first** mention of each core topic to its service page — at most one link per
service and 4 per post, never inside an existing link or a heading.

That safety net means posts are never link-less, but the automatic pass is
deliberately minimal. **Writers should still add their own contextual links**
in Markdown where it reads naturally — especially the anchor text a human would
click ("upgrade your panel", "install an EV charger"). Author links win; the
auto-linker only fills first-mention gaps it finds.

**Canonical service URLs (use these exact paths):**

| Topic / anchor phrases | Link to |
|------------------------|---------|
| panel upgrade, electrical panel upgrade, 200-amp panel/service, service upgrade | `https://911electrics.com/electrical-panel-upgrades-los-angeles-ca/` |
| EV charger, EV charger installation, Level 2 charger, NEMA 14-50, Tesla Wall Connector | `https://911electrics.com/ev-charger-installation-los-angeles-ca/` |
| rewiring, knob-and-tube, aluminum wiring, electrical repair, troubleshooting | `https://911electrics.com/electrical-repairs-los-angeles-ca/` |
| lighting installation, recessed lighting, landscape lighting | `https://911electrics.com/lighting-installation-upgrades-los-angeles-ca/` |
| new construction, ADU wiring | `https://911electrics.com/new-construction-electrical-los-angeles-ca/` |
| emergency electrician, 24/7, power outage | `https://911electrics.com/emergency-electrician-los-angeles-ca/` |

Markdown link syntax (converted to real links server-side):

```markdown
A [panel upgrade](https://911electrics.com/electrical-panel-upgrades-los-angeles-ca/)
is usually required before an
[EV charger installation](https://911electrics.com/ev-charger-installation-los-angeles-ca/)
in an older Pasadena home.
```

Guidelines:

- Link the **first natural mention** of a topic, not every mention.
- 2–5 internal links per post is plenty. Don't stuff.
- Link the descriptive phrase, not "click here".
- For a **city** post, you can also link the city's own page, e.g.
  `https://911electrics.com/electrician-pasadena-ca/`.

## 4. Worked example (Pasadena, published post #7)

The Pasadena panel-upgrade rebate post now ends with this section — it is the
pattern to copy for utility accuracy + internal links:

```markdown
## Pasadena Water & Power (PWP) Rebates

Pasadena runs on its own municipal utility, Pasadena Water & Power (PWP) — not
Southern California Edison — so its rebate programs and amounts differ from
SCE's. Pasadena homeowners can currently qualify for up to **$1,000 toward an
[electrical panel upgrade](https://911electrics.com/electrical-panel-upgrades-los-angeles-ca/)**
and up to **$600 toward a home
[EV charger installation](https://911electrics.com/ev-charger-installation-los-angeles-ca/)**
through PWP. Amounts and eligibility change, so confirm the current terms on
PWP's website before you apply …
```

## 5. Quick checklist per post

- [ ] Jurisdiction identified first, then the utility
      (LADWP / PWP / GWP / BWP / SCE — see §2).
- [ ] No SCE rebate figures attributed to an LADWP/PWP/GWP/BWP area, and no
      invented figures for LADWP, GWP or BWP.
- [ ] Permit authority named correctly (LADBS / LA County Public Works / the
      city's own building division).
- [ ] 2–5 internal links to the service pages above, first-mention, natural anchors.
- [ ] Unique title + slug (check `GET /api/blog/publish`).
- [ ] `excerpt` set (drives the card + meta description).
- [ ] Hero image with descriptive `heroImageAlt`.
