      'Licensed electrician in El Monte, CA. Panel upgrades, repairs, EV chargers and 24/7 service for the city’s high share of pre-1970 homes. Call 747-255-8595.',
    intro: `A large share of El Monte’s housing was built before 1970, and much of it still runs on the original electrical service. Undersized 100-amp (and smaller) panels, ungrounded circuits, and obsolete equipment are common — and they’re the first thing that has to change before a home can add modern AC, a remodel, or EV charging.

We handle [electrical panel upgrades](https://911electrics.com/electrical-panel-upgrades-los-angeles-ca/) throughout El Monte — replacing old and obsolete panels with modern 200-amp services, permit and inspection included.`,
    localNotes: `We serve El Monte from the Valley Boulevard corridor to the Norwood and Mountain View neighborhoods and along Santa Anita Avenue and Peck Road.
